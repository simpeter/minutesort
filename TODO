x Map large pages
  x Already done (check via tracefs)

x Copy keys to DRAM first
  x Huge speedup
  x Use stdio to read/write records
    x also speedup
  x Or PMDK with non-temporal writes of 100B size?
    x Made it worse

* Replace qsort/memcmp with something else?
  * AVX-512 sort? Didn't find one that can treat arbitrary keys.
   
* Split keys from pointers in DRAM. Reduce pointer size.

x Allow non-power-of-two number of mappers
